    "That's enough examining the data visually, now you'll write some code and get some answers! This section uses the pandas library. Your very first task is to ensure you can load and read the CSV data. The pandas library has a fast CSV loader, and the result is placed in a dataframe, as in previous lessons. The CSV we are loading has over half a million rows, but only 17 columns. Pandas gives you lots of powerful ways to interact with a dataframe, including the ability to perform operations on every row.\n",
